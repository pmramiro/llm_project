<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to the field of tissue, such as an allograft, storage and more specifically to the field of long-term tissue storage and preservation.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Allograft or other tissue samples are used to treat many diseases and/or defects. These grafts are procured from organ donors and must be stored to allow for viral and bacterial testing for safety prior to shipping to surgical centers for implantation into patients. Based on studies looking at viability of the cells in the grafts, recommendations have been given for implanting tissues as soon after harvest as possible in order to maximize success. Safety testing takes a minimum of 7 days and more often 10-14 days for final clearance. Storage of tissue, such as allograft tissue, for transplantation or other scientific or medical purposes allows time for medical testing, recipient patient preparation, or to preserve tissues for other purposes. Storage conditions for allograft or other tissue samples may influence tissue viability, integrity, and/or sterility.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The following definitions and methods are provided to better define the present invention and to guide those of ordinary skill in the art in the practice of the present invention. Unless otherwise noted, terms are to be understood according to conventional usage by those of ordinary skill in the relevant art.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The present disclosure provides a process and apparatus for tissue preservation. The process includes, in one embodiment, removing viable tissue, such as allograft tissue, from a donor, testing of the tissue for infectious diseases and/or mechanical and/or biochemical activity for viability, placement of the viable tissue into a sterile tissue culture preservation chamber as described herein with a culture medium capable of maintaining the viability and sterility of the tissue, and storing the tissue for extended periods of time prior to implantation into a recipient. As used herein, the term &#x201c;allograft&#x201d; refers to a tissue graft from a donor of the same species as the recipient but not genetically identical. In an embodiment, at least about 90% of tissue or allografts preserved by the process described herein remain viable after 45 days of storage. In another embodiment, the tissue is lavaged in isotonic solution prior to storing. In still another embodiment, the tissue is allograft tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Allograft tissue can be removed from a donor by techniques known in the art. For instance, general aseptic surgical methods or other physical intervention of an allograft may include but are not limited to excision, resection, amputation, transplantation, microsurgery, general surgery, laser surgery, robotic surgery, or autopsy, among others.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Tissue or allograft sources may be cells, tissues, or organs from all types of organisms, including, but not limited to human, porcine, ovine, bovine, canine, equine, and others. In one embodiment, the source of the tissue or allograft is human. Potential allograft sources may include, but are not limited to, tissues of the eye, brain, heart, kidney, liver, intestine, bone, cartilage, skin, lung, thyroid, stomach, ligaments, tendons, or any other tissue and/or cell source that may require transplantation. In one embodiment of the invention, the allograft may comprise bone and/or cartilage and/or meniscus tissue of the spine, scapula, humerus, radius, ulna, pelvis, femur, tibia, fibula, patella, talus, phalanges, or temporomandibular joint. In another embodiment, the allograft may be osteochondral tissue. Although the description herein may refer to allograft tissue, one of skill in the art appreciates that other tissues find use in the method.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Once removed from the donor, the allograft is stored within the sterile tissue culture chamber including, but not limited to, the chamber described herein, for an extended period of time. In one embodiment, the allograft is stored at room temperature in culture media. In specific embodiments, the room temperature is between about 19&#xb0; C. and 27&#xb0; C., including about 19&#xb0; C., 20&#xb0; C., 21&#xb0; C., 22&#xb0; C., 23&#xb0; C., 24&#xb0; C., 25&#xb0; C., 26&#xb0; C., or about 26&#xb0; C. In another embodiment, the allograft is stored at a temperature that is not less than about 12&#xb0; C. and not more than about 30&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As used herein, the term &#x201c;culture media&#x201d; refers to liquid, semi-solid, or solid media used to support tissue growth and/or preservation and/or development in a non-native environment. Further, by culture media is meant a sterile solution that is capable of stabilizing and preserving the tissue in order to maintain its biological activity and sterility. Suitable tissue culture media are known to one of skill in the art, as discussed in detail subsequently. The media components can be obtained from suppliers other than those identified herein and can be optimized for use by those of skill in the art according to their requirements. Culture media components are well known to one of skill in the art and concentrations and/or components may be altered as desired or needed. In one embodiment, culture media may contain Dulbecco' s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), glucose, antibiotic compounds, antimycotic compounds, dexamethasome, ascorbate 2-phosphate, L-proline, sodium pyruvate, TGF-&#x3b2;3, insulin, transferrin, and selenous acid, among other chemicals or compounds. In particular, antibiotic compounds may include, but are not limited to penicillin, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, gentamycin, and the like. Antimycotic compounds may include, but are not limited to Fungizone. In an embodiment, the culture media lacks serum. The media-to-tissue ratio within the sterile tissue culture chamber may be 10-50:1 per volume.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">An unexpected benefit of the present procedure is that tissue samples can be maintained viable and sterile for an extended period of time relative to methods of the prior art. For instance, typically in the prior art, upon removal of an allograft from a donor, the tissue was stored on ice or at around 4&#xb0; C. Tissues prepared according to this method tended to remain suitably viable for around 21-28 days. However, the procedure described herein provides for a surprising and unexpected increase in viability of allograft tissue. Tissues prepared and stored according to the procedure described herein remain viable for an extended period of time relative to storage at 4&#xb0; C. By an extended period is meant at least between about 7-100 days, at least between about 20-80 days, or at least between about 29-70, 40-70, 50-70 or 60-70 days. In one embodiment an extended period is meant up to at least around 70 days.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">It has been found that long-term storage of tissue may be facilitated by replacement of old culture medium with fresh, sterile medium. However, prior to the present disclosure, a system that allowed for media exchange in an otherwise non-sterile environment was not available. The present disclosure provides a system and device that allows for just this. Advantageously, the present procedures and device provide for sterile media exchange in an otherwise non-sterile environment. Thus, media can be conveniently changed as necessary. In one embodiment, the media is changed at least once, twice, or three times during storage. The media may be changed without removing a lid from the storage container, or otherwise opening the container. The media may be changed, in specific embodiments, about once every other day, at least once a week, at least once every two weeks, or at least about once a month during storage. In one embodiment, media is aspirated from the sterile chamber through a media outlet, and replaced by adding fresh media through a media inlet, as described in more detail below with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. In one embodiment, a filter is placed between the lid and base chamber and media flows through the filter into the chamber. Therefore, the media remains sterile. In addition, the filter enables exchange of CO<sub>2 </sub>and O<sub>2 </sub>between the chamber and the surrounding air while maintaining sterility inside the chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Prior to storage according to the present disclosure, testing of allograft tissue encompassed up to or greater than 7 days and required direct contact with the allograft. Such methods increased the likelihood of allograft contamination. The present disclosure provides a convenient and easy method of testing for viability and/or contamination, by simply extracting the culture medium from the culture chamber through the media outlet, which does not compromise sterility of the tissue. The extended storage period allows for examination or testing of the allograft and/or culture media for a number of factors, such as viability, blood type compatibility, HLA typing, genotyping, SNP detection, and/or infection with diseases. Compounds that may be detected or tested may be obtained from culture media withdrawn from the sterile tested such as, but not limited to, bacterial or virus infections, nitric oxide, prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, and MMP-13, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, and IL-18, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), Interferon gamma-induced protein (IP)-10, IFN&#x3b3;, keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC), MCP-1, and TNF&#x3b1;. Tissue may be tested using methods known in the art, such as by diagnostic PCR or with antibodies against biomarkers such as, but not limited to, those described above. The viability of the OCA may also be monitored during storage by adding a resazurin solution to the media at a final concentration of about 10 &#x3bc;g/ml and incubated at room temperature for 18-24 hours. During the incubation, resazurin is converted to resorufin by viable cells in the OCA. A 200-&#x3bc;l sample of the media is taken and the fluorescence level is determined using a fluorescence reader (540-570 nm excitation, 580-610 nm emission). Increased fluorescence is indicative of higher cell viability. Higher viability samples typically have a fluorescence reading of &#x2dc;800-1200 units using a Synergy HT set at a sensitivity of 25 on the reader.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In view of the above, the process provides for preservation of at least 70% of the allograft tissue chondrocytes after storage at room temperature for 45 days. In an embodiment, at least 60% or 70%, up to at least around 99%, including 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, or 95% or greater of the tissue is preserved when stored for 45 days, 60 days, or 70 days.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In one embodiment, the process includes storing the tissue in a tissue preservation chamber. In another embodiment, the process further includes implanting the tissue in a subject in need thereof following said storing.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">An illustrative embodiment of a tissue preservation chamber <b>100</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2A, and 2B</figref>. The tissue preservation chamber <b>100</b> includes a base <b>102</b> that may be formed from any suitable material for storing tissue, e.g., an allograft. The tissue preservation chamber <b>100</b> also includes a lid <b>106</b> that forms a sealed enclosure when applied to the base. To form the sealed enclosure, the base <b>102</b> may have a first sealing surface <b>140</b> and the lid <b>106</b> may include second sealing surface <b>142</b> that abut one another when the lid <b>106</b> is applied to the base <b>102</b>. In the illustrative embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the lid <b>106</b> is sized and configured to be installed to the base <b>102</b> such that the first sealing surface <b>140</b> and second sealing surface <b>142</b> are adjacent and coplanar about the periphery of the tissue preservation canister <b>100</b>. In such an embodiment, a sterile environment may be ensured by applying a tape about the common surface formed at the interface of the lid <b>106</b> and base <b>102</b>. In an embodiment, the lid <b>106</b> may be formed with a mating feature, such as a lip on the underside of the lid <b>106</b> that forms an interference fit with the interior surface of the base <b>102</b>. In the illustrative embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the lid <b>106</b> and base <b>102</b> have a rectangular shape, though it is noted that the tissue preservation chamber may be of any suitable size and shape.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In an illustrative embodiment, the lid <b>106</b> includes features to facilitate the controlled ingress and egress of gas and liquids to and from the tissue preservation chamber <b>100</b>. These features include a media outlet <b>110</b>, media inlet <b>114</b>, and gas exchange port <b>112</b>. In an embodiment, the lid <b>106</b> also includes a filter basket mount <b>146</b> that may be used to attach a filter basket <b>104</b>.

Yet in some embodiments, the tissue preservation chamber <b>100</b> may include a filter basket <b>104</b> capable of holding multiple filters, or multiple filter baskets to facilitate the use of separate filters for filtering flow through the media inlet <b>114</b> and gas exchange port <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The top surface of the lid <b>106</b> includes protrusions that form the media inlet <b>114</b>, the gas exchange port <b>112</b>, and media outlet <b>110</b>. The media inlet <b>114</b> may also form a similar protrusion that extends from the inner surface of the lid <b>106</b>, and is located inside of the filter basket mount <b>146</b> so that fluid entering the tissue preservation chamber <b>100</b> via the media inlet <b>112</b> is routed through the filter basket <b>104</b>. The gas exchange port <b>112</b> may also form a similar protrusion that extends from the inner surface of the lid <b>106</b>, and is located inside of the filter basket mount <b>146</b> so that fluid entering the tissue preservation chamber <b>100</b> via the gas exchange port <b>112</b> is forced through the filter basket <b>104</b>. The protrusions that form the media inlet <b>114</b>, gas exchange port <b>112</b>, and media outlet <b>110</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> comprise tapered annular members that are suitable for coupling to, e.g., a tubing adapter. Nonetheless, the media inlet <b>114</b>, gas exchange port <b>112</b>, and media outlet <b>110</b> may have any suitable size and shape to facilitate fluid flow to and from the tissue preservation chamber <b>100</b>. For example, in an embodiment, the portions of the lid <b>106</b> that protrude from the top surface of the lid <b>106</b> to form the media inlet <b>114</b> and media outlet <b>110</b> include a tapered surface to facilitate coupling to tubing adapters <b>118</b> and <b>116</b>, respectively. Similarly, in an illustrative embodiment, the media outlet <b>110</b> is fluidly coupled to a media outlet conduit <b>108</b> that extends into the tissue preservation chamber <b>100</b> to facilitate the removal of fluid from the base of the media outlet conduit <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The tissue preservation chamber <b>100</b> illustrated in the Figures is operable to store living tissue. In the illustrative embodiments, the media outlet <b>110</b> and media inlet <b>114</b> facilitate the addition and removal of liquid, e.g., tissue culture media, to and from the tissue preservation chamber <b>100</b> while preserving a sealed, sterile environment within the tissue preservation chamber <b>100</b>. Thus, once made, the tissue preservation chamber <b>100</b> described above finds use in a method of allograft preservation in which a tissue sample or allograft is stored in the tissue preservation chamber.

Discussion
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0054">The media concentrations of the proteins analyzed in this study were very low for tissues cultured at 4&#xb0; C. after the first week of culture. This indicates that the tissue becomes quiescent under these non-physiologic culture conditions. Conversely, the OCAs cultured at 37&#xb0; C. maintained a relatively high level of protein production indicating that the chondrocytes remain metabolically active during preservation.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0055">Of the proteins analyzed, MMP-2, MMP-3, KC, MCP-1, and IL-8 were produced most consistently. The stable release of NO and PGE2 to the media throughout the preservation period by tissues stored at 4&#xb0; C. was a surprising finding. Without being bound by theory, it is possible that the release of these two inflammatory indicators results from the progressive cell death within the tissue and requires very little metabolic activity by the tissue to be produced. The NO and PGE2 data indicate that there is a continued and stable production of these inflammatory mediators during the preservation of the OCAs at 4 and 37&#xb0; C. in M1 and M2. Importantly, the M-3 media significantly reduced the media levels of these two inflammatory mediators, indicating that M-3 may protect the tissues during culture by decreasing inflammation and potentially improving the health of the OCA.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0056">A potential contributing factor to failure of OCA procedures clinically relates to the viability of the tissue at the time of implantation. Therefore, a biomarker assay that can differentiate between tissues with low and high viability by testing the preservation media prior to implantation would be of great value to tissue banks and the surgeons using them clinically. These data suggest that proteins evaluated in this study are potential markers for assessment of functional viability of OCAs. Taken together with previous work assessing cell viability and matrix composition of preserved OCAs, preservation of osteochondral tissues in Media 3 and 37&#xb0; C. is likely to allow for preserving higher quality grafts for a longer time period than currently used protocols</p>

<p id="p-0052" num="0057">Osteochondral allografts (OCAs) are currently preserved at 4&#xb0; C. and used within 28 days of donor harvest. The window of opportunity for implantation is limited to 14 days due to a two week disease testing protocol, severely limiting availability to potential recipients. This study was performed to assess the effects of storage up to 56 days in a serum-free chemically defined media at 37&#xb0; C. OCAs from adult canine cadavers were aseptically harvested within four hours of euthanasia. Medial and lateral femoral condyles were stored in Media 1 or 2 at 4&#xb0; C. or 37&#xb0; C. for up to 56 days. Chondrocyte viability, proteoglycan (GAG) and collagen (HP) content, biomechanical properties, and collagen II and aggrecan content were assessed at Days 28 and 56. Five femoral condyles were stored overnight and assessed the next day to serve as controls. Storage in Media 1 at 37&#xb0; C. maintained chondrocyte viability at significantly higher levels than in any other media-temperature combination examined and at levels not significantly different from controls.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0058">OCAs stored in either media at 4&#xb0; C. showed a significant decrease in chondrocyte viability throughout storage. GAG and HP content were maintained through 56 days of storage in OCAs in Media 1 at 37&#xb0; C. There were no significant differences in elastic or dynamic moduli among groups at Day 56. Qualitative immunohistochemistry demonstrated the presence of collagen II and aggrecan throughout all layers of cartilage during storage. OCA viability, matrix content and composition, and biomechanical properties were maintained at &#x201c;fresh&#x201d; levels through 56 days of storage in media 1 at 37&#xb0; C. OCAs stored at 4&#xb0; C. were unable to maintain viability or matrix integrity through 28 days of storage.

Day 0 Control OCAs (n=5) were aseptically harvested from one femoral condyle of 5 adult canine cadavers euthanized for reasons unrelated to this study. These OCAs were stored overnight in serum-free media and evaluated the following day.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0060">The volume of each OCA (n=40) was determined and storage media volumes used were 25-30 times OCA volume.

Media 1 was designed to provide basic nutrition to the tissue and Media 2 was designed to be anti-inflammatory and chondrogenic. Each stored specimen had its own contralateral control on the opposite leg. The media were changed every 7 days and media samples were saved for subsequent analyses. At each time point full-thickness cartilage was evaluated for chondrocyte viability, biochemical composition, and biomechanical properties.
<ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0062">Tissue Viability Analysis: Full-thickness cartilage from each storage group was used to determine chondrocyte viability. Quantitative analysis of chondrocyte viability was determined by manually counting live and dead cells from images for the entire sample taken at 10&#xd7;magnification using an Olympus F view II camera and Micro Suite Basic Edition software. CellTracker&#x2122; Green CMFDA (5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was used to visualize live cells and ethidium homodimer-1 (EthD-1, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to visualize dead cells. Percent live cells were determined by taking the total number of live cells divided by the total amount of cells in the sample.</li>
    <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0063">GAG Content: After PBS wash, cartilage plugs were blotted with a paper wipe and weighed on balance to obtain the wet weight. Dry weight was determined after lyophilization for 24 hours. Cartilage tissue was the then digested in 50 &#x3bc;L papain solution for 3 hours at 60&#xb0; C. Sulfated-GAG (s-GAG) concentration within the cartilage matrix was determined using aliquots of digest solution using the 1,9 dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) dye-binding assay. S-GAG content was determined from the ratio of s-GAG to total tissue dry weight and reported at &#x3bc;ug GAG/mg dry weight.</li>
    <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0064">HP Content: The hydroxyproline (HP) content was determined using a colorimetric assay modified to a 96-well format. HP content was used as a measure of total collagen content. A 50-&#x3bc;L aliquot of the digest solution was mixed with 50 &#x3bc;L 4N NaOH and the mixture was autoclaved for 20 minutes at 121&#xb0; C. to hydrolyze the sample. The sample was then mixed with the chloramine T reagent and incubated at 25&#xb0; C. for 25 minutes, followed by mixing with Ehrlich aldehyde reagent. The chlorophore was developed at 65&#xb0; C. for 20 minutes. The absorbance was then read at 550 nm using a Synergy HT (Bio-TEK, Highland Park, VT) and the samples were compared with an HP standard to determine the HP concentration of the sample. Results were standardized to tissue dry weight and reported as &#x3bc;g HP/mg dry weight.</li>
    <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0065">Biomechanical Analysis: At each end point, 4-mm plugs were removed from the articular cartilage and immediately put in a &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. freezer until biomechanical testing could be done. The dynamic modulus of cartilage specimens were determined by unconfined compression with loading to 10% strain at a rate of 0.05% per second, after an initial 0.02-N tare load (elastic modulus, or Ey). Dynamic modulus (G*) was measured by superimposing 2% peak-to-peak sinusoidal strain at 0.1 Hz. Values were reported as megapascals (MPa).</li>
    <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0066">Immunohistochemical Analysis: For immunohistochemical evaluation, 2-mm sagittal sections of OCAs were cut and fixed in 10% formalin.

After decalcification and subsequent routine histologic processing, each specimen was embedded in paraffin, and sectioned 5 &#x3bc;m through the sagittal plane. For immunohistochemical analysis, unstained sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in graded ethanol solutions. The samples were permeabilized with a 0.1% trypsin solution at 36&#xb0; C. for 60 minutes and then blocked with a 10% bovine serum albumin at 40&#xb0; C. Slides were incubated overnight at 4&#xb0; C. in predetermined dilutions of the primary antibodies: collagen type II (rabbit polyclonal antibody, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and proteoglycan (mouse anti-human antibody, Millipore Corp., Billerica, Mass.).</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0067">The next day, slides were rinsed in Tris-buffered saline before being incubated with the secondary antibody. Collagen type II was labeled with goat anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC, Millipore Corp., Billerica, Mass.) and proteoglycan was labeled with goat anti-mouse rhodamine (Millipore Corp., Billerica, Mass.). Samples were coverslipped and reviewed using fluorescent light microscopy. Negative controls were used as comparison in which the primary (but not secondary antibody) was omitted from the slides to see if any stain was due to fluorescence aside from the target region. Immunohistochemical images were subjectively assessed.

<p id="p-0059" num="0072">Osteochondral allografts (OCA) allow transplantation of viable, functional tissue for treatment of cartilage defects without the need for immunosuppression. OCAs are reported to be successful in &#x3e;75% of cases when used for treatment of focal femoral condyle lesions. The present study was designed to evaluate the ability of biomarkers to differentiate OCAs with low viability during culture using various tissue preservation protocols.

    <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0073">Tissue Harvest and Culture: Medial and lateral femoral condyles (FC) from both knees of 10 adult canine cadavers were aseptically harvested within 4 hours of euthanasia performed for reasons unrelated to this study. The volume of each FC was determined and the FCs (OCAs, n=40) were processed under aseptic conditions and preserved in Media 1 (M-1) or Media 2 (M-2) at 4&#xb0; C. or 37&#xb0; C. for 28 or 56 days. The volume of media used for preservation was determined by multiplying the approximate volume of the tissue by 25-30.

    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0075">Tissue Viability Analysis: Cartilage tissue was analyzed for cell viability using a fluorescent live/dead assay (Invitrogen) and fluorescent microscopy. Images were taken at 10&#xd7; magnification using an Olympus F-View II camera and MicroSuite Basic Edition software. For the M-1 and M-2 samples, two tissue sections were used for evaluation of tissue viability. For the M-3 samples at least three tissue sections were taken for evaluation of tissue viability. Green-staining live cells were manually counted and the area of the tissue analyzed was determined using MicroSuite Basic Edition. Because % cell viability does not take into account total loss of cells, the area of the tissue section analyzed was measured, and the ratio of live cells (LC)/area (mm2) was determined.</li>
    <li id="ul0007-0002" num="0076">Media Analysis: Media were analyzed for MMP-2, -3, and -13 (R&#x26;D System) and IL-8, KC, and MCP-1 (Millipore) using two Luminex multiplex assay.</li>

    <li id="ul0007-0006" num="0080">M-1 37&#xb0; C. Culture Groups: The variability in the tissue viability of the M-1 group was relatively low, and the viability of the tissues was relatively high. Therefore, there was not a distinct difference in the biomarker values of the samples with low viability (&#x2dc;0.7 LC/mm2) and high viability (&#x2265;1.0 LC/mm2).

MCP-1 had weak-moderate (0.339-0.613) positive correlations with tissue viability throughout the culture period. MMP-2, MMP-3, and MMP-13 all had a moderate-strong (0.651-0.927) positive correlations on days 7 and 28, and a weak-moderate (0.337-0.6) positive correlations on day 56. The two samples with the lowest tissue viability (&#x3c;0.1 LC/mm2) had little to no detectable KC, IL-8, MCP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, and MMP-13 after day 7.</li>
    <li id="ul0007-0008" num="0082">M-3 37&#xb0; C.

After day 14, little to no MCP-1, IL-8, and KC detectable in the media of the low viability sample. Early in culture, KC and MCP-1 had strong (0.815-0.972) positive correlations to tissue viability, and at later time points in culture each had moderate (0.5-0.78) positive correlations to tissue viability. At all time points, IL-8 had moderate (0.566-0.751) positive correlations to cell viability. MMP-2 had strong (0.811-0.907) positive correlations through day 21; MMP-3 had strong (0.889-0.968) positive correlations after day 7; and MMP-13 had weak (0.3-0.461) positive correlations to tissue viability at all time points. The sample with the lowest tissue viability (0.00 LC/mm2) had little to no detectable KC, IL-8, and MCP- 1 after day 7, but MMP-2, MMP-3, and MMP-13 could be detected at all time points.</li>

</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0083">These data indicate that proteins in the preservation media have the potential to act as biomarkers for distinguishing OCAs that have very low cell viability and therefore are not considered suitable for clinical use. If implemented, tissue banks could readily and repeatedly assess the usefulness of the tissue during the preservation period without the need for sectioning the grafts. This would essentially allow tissue banks to cull samples as soon as they are no longer acceptable for clinical use, saving time and expense. It would also allow surgeons to have more confidence in the quality of the grafts that they are implanting into patients. KC, MCP-1, and MMP-3 are the strongest candidate biomarkers to identify OCAs with low tissue viability during culture.</p>

    <li id="ul0009-0012" num="0105">VEGF: In study 1 the media level of VEGF was stable over time in the M-1/C-3 group, but decreased over time in all other groups. In study 2 the level of VEGF was stable in all groups over time in culture. In study 1 the M-2/C-1 group had significantly lower media VEGF concentrations compared to all groups on day 7 and the M-1/C-2 and M-1/C-3 groups on day 56. In study 2 the M-3/C-3 group had significantly lower media VEGF concentrations compared to the M-1/C-3 group at all time points and the M-1/C-1 group on days 7 and 28.

<p id="p-0067" num="0106">These data indicate that OCA tissues are metabolically active during 25&#xb0; C. storage, and that the same proteins detected in previous studies at 37&#xb0; C. storage are also detected at 25&#xb0; C. storage. Further, the pattern of production of these biomarkers at 25&#xb0; C. is similar to that observed at 37&#xb0; C.</p>

<heading id="h-0021" level="1">Optimization of Long-term Osteochondral Allograft Storage at 25&#xb0; C.</heading>
<p id="p-0068" num="0107">Osteoarthritis (OA) affects &#x2dc;90% of people older than 65, and associated costs top $100 billion annually in the U.S. One treatment available for focal lesions is osteochondral allografts (OCA) transplantation. OCAs are reported to be successful in &#x3e;75% of cases when used for treatment of focal femoral condyle lesions. Currently, tissue banks store OCAs at 4&#xb0; C., and implantation is recommended within 28 days after harvest due to significant loss in tissue viability by this time point. Because mandatory disease screening protocols typically take 14 days to complete, the window for surgical implantation is narrow (&#x2dc;14 days), which severely limits clinical use. Therefore, this study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of culturing OCAs at 25&#xb0; C. using novel media compositions and container conditions for extending the pre-implantation life span of harvested tissue based on tissue viability and matrix composition.</p>
<p id="h-0022" num="0000">Methods:</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0000">
<ul id="ul0010" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0108">Tissue harvest and culture: During the course of two studies, medial and lateral femoral condyles (FC) from both knees of 14 adult canine cadavers were aseptically harvested within 4 hours of euthanasia performed for reasons unrelated to this study. The FCs were either used as day 0 controls (n=7) or separated into one of 5 test groups based on different media composition (M-1 (DMEM, 1&#xd7; ITS (insulin, transferrin, and selenous acid), L-glutamine (20 mM), non-essential amino acids (1 mM), sodium pyruvate (10 mM), L-ascorbic acid (50 &#x3bc;g/ml), penicillin, streptomycin, and amphotericin B), M-2 (DMEM, 1&#xd7; ITS (insulin, transferrin, and selenous acid), L-glutamine (20 mM), non-essential amino acids (1 mM), sodium pyruvate (10 mM), L-ascorbic acid (50 &#x3bc;g/ml), penicillin, streptomycin, amphotericin B, and sodium borate (250 &#x3bc;g/ml)), M-3 (DMEM, 1&#xd7; ITS (insulin, transferrin, and selenous acid), L-glutamine (20 mM), non-essential amino acids (1 mM), sodium pyruvate (10 mM), L-ascorbic acid (50 &#x3bc;g/ml), penicillin, streptomycin, amphotericin B, and dexamethasone (0.01 &#x3bc;M))) and container condition (C-1, C-2, C-3) such that each FC from a single animal was placed in distinct group. The following media and container condition groupings were assessed for this study M-1/C-1, M-1/C-2, M-1/C-3, M-2/C-1, and M-3/C-3, resulting in the 5 different OCA storage groups. Tissues were stored at 25&#xb0; C. without CO2 supplementation in 60m1s of media for at least 63 days and up to 75 days. The media were changed every 7 days and saved for biomarker analyses. At the end of storage, osteochondral plugs were evaluated for tissue viability and matrix composition.</li>
    <li id="ul0010-0002" num="0109">Viability Analysis: Cartilage tissue was analyzed for cell viability using a fluorescent live/dead assay (Invitrogen) and fluorescent microscopy. Osteochondral tissues were incubated in stain for 25 minutes at 25&#xb0; C. Images were taken at either 4&#xd7; (study 1) or 10&#xd7; (study 2) magnification. Green-staining live cells were manually counted, and the area of the tissue analyzed was determined. The viability of the tissue is expressed as the ratio of live cells (LC)/area (&#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>). Because the focal depth of 4&#xd7; images was significantly different than the focal depth of 10&#xd7; images, the viability could not be compared between the 4&#xd7; and 10&#xd7; images, and analysis was only performed between samples that were taken at the same magnification.</li>
    <li id="ul0010-0003" num="0110">Matrix composition: Cartilage tissue was lyophilized and weighed, digested with papain, and analyzed for proteoglycan content using the DMMB assay and collagen content using a hydroxyproline assay. GAG and collagen content was normalized to tissue dry weight.</li>
    <li id="ul0010-0004" num="0111">Data Analysis: Data were compared by ANOVA and the Tukey post-hoc test using SigmaStat.</li>
    <li id="ul0010-0005" num="0112">RESULTS: Day 0 and day 63-75 tissue viability (Table 2): The mean tissue viability and range are listed for each group at day 63 for each magnification. For the samples analyzed at 4&#xd7; magnification, day 0 and the M-3/C-3 group had significantly higher tissue viability (LC/mm2) compared to the M-1/C-1 and M-2/C-1 groups at day 63, and the M-1/C- 3 group had significantly higher tissue viability compared to the M-2/C-1 group at day 63. The M-3/C-3 group had the highest mean viability and the lowest variability of all the storage groups tested. The sample size was smaller for the 10&#xd7; magnification groups, and there was not a significant difference between the groups as seen in the first set of samples analyzed at 4&#xd7; magnification. However, in agreement with the 4&#xd7; data, the M-3/C-3 group had the highest viability with the lowest variability and was closest to day 0 viability values.</li>
    <li id="ul0010-0006" num="0113">Day 0 and day 63-75 cell distribution: The day 0 and M-3/C-3 groups had good cell numbers distributed through the thickness of the tissue. The M-1/C-1 and M-1/C-2 groups typically had very low cell numbers in the superficial-middle zones of the tissue and higher cell numbers in the deep-middle zones of the tissue. The M-2/C-1 group had very few detectable viable cells in any region of the tissue.</li>
    <li id="ul0010-0007" num="0114">Matrix composition (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>): The proteoglycan content of the M-3/C-3 group was significantly lower than the day 0 and all other storage groups. The GAG content of the tissues was not a significantly different between any other groups in this study. The HP content of the first set of tissues stored could not analyzed for HP content, so there is no HP data for the M-1/C-2 and M-2/C-1 groups tissues. Of the samples tested, there was not a significant difference between the groups tested.</li>
    <li id="ul0010-0008" num="0115">DISCUSSION: These data indicate that femoral condyle OCA tissue stored at 25&#xb0; C. without CO2 supplementation can maintain day 0 tissue viability up to 75 days in storage. This is a significant improvement over current protocols at 4&#xb0; C., which shows significant loss of tissue viability by day 28 of storage.</li>

The following five media and container condition groupings were assessed for this study: M-1/C-1, M-1/C-2, M-1/C-3, M-2/C-1, and M-3/C-3. Tissues were stored at 25&#xb0; C. without CO2 supplementation in 60m1s of media for at least 63 days and up to 75 days. The media were changed every 7 days and saved for biomarker analyses. On the next to last day of storage, 6 mls of the cell viability media additive as added to each sample and incubated for 24 hours. After 24 hours, a media sample was analyzed for level of fluorescence at a standard sensitivity. Increased fluorescence in the media is indicative of cell metabolism and viability.</li>
    <li id="ul0011-0002" num="0119">Media Analysis: Media were analyzed for VEGF, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, -3, -9, and -13 (R&#x26;D System); and IL-6, IL-8, KC, and MCP-1 by Luminex multiplex assay (Millipore).</li>
    <li id="ul0011-0003" num="0120">Tissue Viability Analysis: Cartilage tissue was analyzed for cell viability using a fluorescent live/dead assay (Invitrogen) and fluorescent microscopy.

The area of the tissue section analyzed was measured, and the ratio of live cells (LC)/area (&#x3bc;m2) was determined.</li>
    <li id="ul0011-0004" num="0121">Data Analysis: Data from the last day of storage were compared by Pearson product-moment correlation using SigmaStat. Since the M-3 media was designed to decrease tissue inflammation, the cytokines and chemokines analyzed in this study were significantly lower in this group compared to all others during the course of storage.
