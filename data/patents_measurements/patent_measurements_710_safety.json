A new poinsettia plant particularly distinguished by having red bracts having an upright habit, and having a triangular plant form, is disclosedGenus and species. Euphorbia pulcherrima. Variety denomination: \u2018NPCW19282\u2019. BACKGROUND OF THE NEW PLANT. The present invention comprises a new and distinct variety of poinsettia, botanically known as. Euphorbia pulcherrima. and hereinafter referred to by the variety name \u2018NPCW19282\u2019.   \u2018NPCW19282\u2019 was derived from a cross conducted indoors in a greenhouse in Juja, Kenya in December 2013 between the female poinsettia \u2018Prima Red\u2019, also known as \u2018Dueprima\u2019 (U. S. Plant Pat. No. 25,480) and the male poinsettia \u2018CHRISTMAS BEAUTY Red\u2019, also known as \u2018NPCW10158\u2019 (U. S. Plant Pat. No. 22,580).Seedlings from the cross were subsequently planted and in August 2014, a single plant was selected in Stuttgart, Germany. In February 2015, \u2018NPCW19282\u2019 was first asexually propagated by vegetative apical cuttings in Stuttgart, Germany. \u2018NPCW19282\u2019 was found to reproduce true to type in successive generations of asexual propagation via vegetative apical cuttings in Stuttgart, Germany. SUMMARY. The following are the most outstanding and distinguishing characteristics of this new variety when grown under normal horticultural practices in Stuttgart, Germany.1. Red bracts having an upright habit; and.2. Having a triangular plant form. DESCRIPTION OF THE PHOTOGRAPH. This new poinsettia plant is illustrated by the accompanying photograph which shows an overall view of the whole plant. The photograph is of a plant approximately 12 weeks old grown indoors in Stuttgart, Germany in December 2017. The colors shown are as true as can be reasonably obtained by conventional photographic procedures. DESCRIPTION OF THE NEW VARIETY. The following detailed descriptions set forth the distinctive characteristics of \u2018NPCW19282\u2019.   The data which define these characteristics were collected from asexual reproductions carried out in Stuttgart, Germany. Data was collected on plants that were 4-months-old and grown in a glass greenhouse under normal horticultural practices in Stuttgart, Germany in November 2019. Color references are to The R. H. S.
