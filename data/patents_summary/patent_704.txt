Apple tree named ‘HOT84A1’. A new and distinct apple variety of. Malus domestica. named ‘HOT84A1’ and characterized by its attractive appearance, its dark red color, and is notable for its long storage life. The variety results from crossing the apple varieties ‘Scired’ (not patented) and ‘Scilate’ (U. S. Plant Pat. No. 20,477) in Havelock North, New ZealandGenus and species plant named. Malus domestica. Variety denomination: ‘HOT84A1’. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION. The new plant variety described herein resulted from a selection from a population of seedlings derived from the controlled crossing of the apple varieties ‘Scired’ (not patented) (seed parent) and ‘Scilate’ (U. S. Plant Pat. No. 20,477) (pollen parent). The planned cross was made in 2002 on trees located in Havelock North, Hawke's Bay, New Zealand and the seed transported and sown in plots in Gimenells near Lleida, Catalonia, Spain. ‘HOT84A1’ was selected in 2007 as a single plant from among a population of seedlings and was selected for its attractive appearance, good flavor, texture and storage. It was asexually propagated first in Lleida, Spain by budding onto M9 rootstock. The variety has since been observed over three asexually propagated generations and found to remain true to type. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION.‘HOT84A1’ is characterized by its attractive fruit with good texture and flavor, harvesting in early October in Spain. Under growing conditions in Spain ‘HOT84A1’ is distinguished from other apple varieties due to the following unique characteristics: Compared to ‘Fuji’, ‘HOT84A1’ has an earlier harvest season by approximately 2 weeks, and a significantly higher proportion of the skin surface is covered by over color, 70-90%, compared to ‘Fuji’, 40-50%.Under the growing conditions in Spain the new variety was able to be distinguished from its parents ‘Scired’ and ‘Scilate’, by the following characteristics.‘Scilate’: The time of eating maturity is later than ‘HOT84A1’. ‘Scired’: ‘HOT84A1’ fruit is larger than ‘Scired’ apples. In addition ‘HOT84A1’ has a fruit skin overcolor pattern of a solid flush with weakly defined stripes; compared to ‘Scired’ which has a solid flush overcolor pattern. Asexual reproduction of this new variety by budding and grafting shows that the aforementioned characteristics are true to form and are established and transmitted through succeeding propagation. This is true of buds grafted onto M9 rootstocks. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF PHOTOGRAPHS.
